# 👁️‍🗨️ Face Detection with Viola-Jones & OpenCV

This project uses the **Viola-Jones algorithm** (based on Haar cascades) along with **OpenCV** to detect human faces in **static images** and **live webcam streams**.

It's a lightweight and efficient solution for real-time face detection with minimal setup.
